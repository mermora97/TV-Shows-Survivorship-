# Optimize Storytelling in the TV Enterteinment Industry
This is my personal repository for my Final Capstone in the MSDS at UVA.
## Our goal? 
To analyze how TV series genres have evolved over time and uncover what drives success and viewer engagement. We’re working with a dataset of 25,000 episodes from 220 TV series, packed with emotion scores, network insights, viewership data, and more. 

What this mean for the entertainment world? 
📊𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀: We’ll help entertainment executives evaluate new series by comparing them with historical hits to spot winning trends and potential.
✍️𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀: By translating scripts into emotion scores, and these into storytelling guidance, we can provide writers with actionable feedback—helping keep audiences engaged. This is especially important with the rising trend of staggered episode releases where feedback can influence ongoing story arcs.
🔍𝗔𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀: We’ll diagnose when and why audiences drop off and suggest data-driven strategies to retain viewership.
We’re still fine-tu![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20aa05a5-96ef-405f-943d-647510f62e53)
