# Optimize Storytelling in the TV Enterteinment Industry
This is my personal repository for my Final Capstone in the MSDS at UVA.
## Our goal? 
To analyze how TV series genres have evolved over time and uncover what drives success and viewer engagement. We’re working with a dataset of 25,000 episodes from 220 TV series, packed with emotion scores, network insights, viewership data, and more. 

What this mean for the entertainment world? 

- **📊Benchmarking Success:** We’ll help entertainment executives evaluate new series by comparing them with historical hits to spot winning trends and potential.
- **✍️Real-time Insights for Writers:** By translating scripts into emotion scores, and these into storytelling guidance, we can provide writers with actionable feedback—helping keep audiences engaged. This is especially important with the rising trend of staggered episode releases where feedback can influence ongoing story arcs.
- **🔍Audience Retention Tools:** We’ll diagnose when and why audiences drop off and suggest data-driven strategies to retain viewership.
